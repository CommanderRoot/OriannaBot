Shows a user's mastery score on a certain champion. To specify a champion, simply include the champion name in the command. If no champion is specified, the server default is used. Most common abbreviations (e.g. \`lee\` for Lee Sin) will also work.
To specify a user, simply mention them in the message. If no users are mentioned, your own score is shown instead.

Examples:
- @Orianna Bot, how many points do I have on mf?
- @Orianna Bot, how much points does @user#1234 have on Lee Sin?
- @Orianna Bot, how many points do I have?
